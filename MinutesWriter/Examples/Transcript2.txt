Transcript


21:07:36 - Neilabh Banzal:
  
 um, another


21:07:37 - Siddhesh Pawar:
  
 are no candidates record this meeting, and then maybe


21:07:39 - Neilabh Banzal:
  
 I will do that. I'll do that. I'll start. Okay, I completely forgot about


21:07:46 - Siddhesh Pawar:
  
 and just read it to the model because


21:07:46 - Neilabh Banzal:
  
 give me one second.


21:07:49 - Siddhesh Pawar:
  
currently wnc has given as like sort of Hard stuff on 24 like it may get extended, but we need to complete better 24. So we need to welcome.


21:07:58 - Neilabh Banzal:
  
 Okay.


21:08:00 - Anirudh Mittal:
  
 The 24 is not the deadline, the deadline is 18 and 21.


21:08:04 - Neilabh Banzal:
  
 Yeah.


21:08:05 - Siddhesh Pawar:
  
 Okay. Oh, okay, fine.


21:08:06 - Anirudh Mittal:
  
Yeah. Oh let's get to that. You can just complete your what you're explaining and then we'll get to that.


21:08:11 - Siddhesh Pawar:
  
 No, like you need up like just record this meeting and just show the results like mother.


21:08:18 - Neilabh Banzal:
  
And started recording the meeting on OBS. So I think that that will, that will generate an audiophile. And I've also started transcription on on using that the extension I was talking about, and


21:08:32 - Siddhesh Pawar:
  
 Yeah, cool. So after two days meet or like maybe


21:08:34 - Neilabh Banzal:
  
 Yeah.


21:08:37 - Siddhesh Pawar:
  
till tomorrow or day after tomorrow, just put the meeting minutes. That are summarized, then the transcription that is generated by our model, and third the transcription by the extension. So, we just need to compare the


21:08:50 - Neilabh Banzal:
  
 yeah, that I


21:08:50 - Siddhesh Pawar:
  
 Manually compared with. yeah, just put it on the group after two days, maybe whenever you


21:08:57 - Neilabh Banzal:
  
 Yeah, sure. I will do that. I'll do that. so,


21:08:59 - Siddhesh Pawar:
  
 So so what are the next steps? Like what are the next steps now


21:09:03 - Neilabh Banzal:
  
 the next steps are, I'm going to put


21:09:04 - Siddhesh Pawar:
  
 currently?


21:09:05 - Anirudh Mittal:
  
 Well sorry, just a second neela before that two things. First, the 18 for a deadline is a form that you have to fill.


21:09:13 - Neilabh Banzal:
  
 Yeah.


21:09:13 - Anirudh Mittal:
  
 You also have to fill


21:09:15 - Neilabh Banzal:
  
 Yeah.


21:09:15 - Anirudh Mittal:
  
 Form, you have to upload the GitHub calling. So the plan is going to create a


21:09:18 - Neilabh Banzal:
  
 Okay.


21:09:20 - Anirudh Mittal:
  
 common repo for either a common day before the theme projects or different repo for this


21:09:25 - Neilabh Banzal:
  
 Haha.


21:09:27 - Anirudh Mittal:
  
 project. He'll send you the invite and in that


21:09:28 - Neilabh Banzal:
  
 Okay.


21:09:30 - Anirudh Mittal:
  
 you


21:09:30 - Neilabh Banzal:
  
 How about this, a common organization and like three Repose. That makes more sense to me.


21:09:38 - Siddhesh Pawar:
  
 common project you


21:09:40 - Neilabh Banzal:
  
 Organization.


21:09:42 - Siddhesh Pawar:
  
 Okay, that can be made.


21:09:43 - Neilabh Banzal:
  
 Check it out, anyway.


21:09:45 - Siddhesh Pawar:
  
 no, like


21:09:46 - Anirudh Mittal:
  
 so what that is this they can


21:09:49 - Siddhesh Pawar:
  
 hard.


21:09:50 - Anirudh Mittal:
  
 IE finally, you are complete your documentation report by 17, ah, you


21:09:55 - Neilabh Banzal:
  
 Okay.


21:09:56 - Anirudh Mittal:
  
have to do the same, and you can just upload the documentation report on the report and all that you have


21:10:02 - Neilabh Banzal:
  
 Okay.


21:10:03 - Anirudh Mittal:
  
 written. So, we prepared some kind of sweet and show, share my screen and show you.


21:10:09 - Neilabh Banzal:
  
 Do you want me to stop saying?


21:10:11 - Anirudh Mittal:
  
 Yeah.


21:10:39 - Anirudh Mittal:
  
 I am on full screen.


21:10:54 - Anirudh Mittal:
  
basically, this is all of, this is the common part for which we are supposed to assign to someone in all


21:11:02 - Neilabh Banzal:
  
 Okay.


21:11:03 - Anirudh Mittal:
  
of you have some kind of code written for each of them at least, like, at least one person will have something really to each of these sections.


21:11:09 - Neilabh Banzal:
  
 Alright.


21:11:10 - Anirudh Mittal:
  
 Will assign to someone and accordingly distribute among the six of you.


21:11:14 - Neilabh Banzal:
  
 Okay.


21:11:15 - Anirudh Mittal:
  
 Overview. And then there is the team specific task.


21:11:18 - Neilabh Banzal:
  
Haha.


21:11:19 - Anirudh Mittal:
  
For each team, you have either pipeline is something like this which is you must have done some research or learning. So that is the first aspect, the other is, and all of this is from the perspective of code because documentation. Anyway, you guys have your own documentation. We are also submit one team documentation, but that will discuss next week in Sunday.


21:11:39 - Neilabh Banzal:
  
Huh. So something like, if I write up python script which does everything then how to use that python script like you say your input and audio file or something like that, right?


21:11:51 - Anirudh Mittal:
  
 No, I don't understand the question, which part I were talking about?


21:11:53 - Neilabh Banzal:
  
So for documentation, you want something like this kid, okay, how do you install this package or how do you clone it? And then skip out, how do you use this package or some suppose I say?


21:12:03 - Anirudh Mittal:
  
 Probably know some not something like


21:12:04 - Neilabh Banzal:
  
 No, we are not talking about that.


21:12:04 - Anirudh Mittal:
  
 that.


21:12:05 - Neilabh Banzal:
  
 Okay.


21:12:06 - Anirudh Mittal:
  
 No. So on the repository you will


21:12:06 - Neilabh Banzal:
  
 Tell me.


21:12:08 - Anirudh Mittal:
  
upload your documentation directly with the format that we have been discussing name of the project underscore your name.


21:12:14 - Neilabh Banzal:
  
 Okay.


21:12:15 - Anirudh Mittal:
  
Then. For each of those sections, you can upload the code directly there in the python file. You can upload. So we can assign people here and accordingly. These people will be responsible to upload the code of this section 14, specific code. You can, there are these things accordingly. upload the code of this section 14, specific code. You can, there are these things


21:12:28 - Neilabh Banzal:
  
 Okay.


21:12:28 - Anirudh Mittal:
  
You can You can, there are these things If you have any code that you have If you have any code that you have used for learning in searching, you can add learning, researching me. If you have any code that you have used for learning in searching, you can add otherwise Resorts will automatically go in the documentation for each totext. If you have any code that you're using for the final project. So, what is on Sunday?


21:12:44 - Neilabh Banzal:
  
 Okay.


21:12:46 - Anirudh Mittal:
  
The The next Sunday, we'll have some kind of demo by three teams, seeing whatever they have built. The other two teams, they are going to present what the pipeline, basically the Prototype of their work.


21:12:56 - Neilabh Banzal:
  
 Okay.


21:12:57 - Anirudh Mittal:
  
When you guys can also present your prototype in which you can show your, you can show some kind of input going in and that output coming in. So they essentially two parts, right? There's a space to text and then there is text processing, just to text.


21:13:10 - Neilabh Banzal:
  
 Right.


21:13:12 - Anirudh Mittal:
  
 Yeah, let's get to that first. What are you using for speech to text?


21:13:18 - Neilabh Banzal:
  
 Ashish. Maybe you can take this question.


21:13:21 - Ashish Gupta:
  
 Yeah, actually I tried that speech recognition. That was working fine.


21:13:24 - Neilabh Banzal:
  
 Huh. You are using speech recognition, right of hahaha and you are done some


21:13:27 - Ashish Gupta:
  
 Yeah.


21:13:28 - Neilabh Banzal:
  
Of hahaha and Of hahaha and you are done some Of hahaha and you are done some five minute, so speech, underscore


21:13:32 - Ashish Gupta:
  
 that that could actually use the audio into


21:13:34 - Neilabh Banzal:
  
 recognition, Library, I think Google Google speech API.


21:13:39 - Ashish Gupta:
  
 I think it is.


21:13:41 - Neilabh Banzal:
  
 we think it's part of,


21:13:41 - Ashish Gupta:
  
 Actually.


21:13:41 - Anirudh Mittal:
  
 Not finding it radio using it directly.


21:13:44 - Neilabh Banzal:
  
 We are using that of the Shelf. No fine.


21:13:45 - Ashish Gupta:
  
 Oh,


21:13:46 - Neilabh Banzal:
  
No Tuning, no nothing.


21:13:47 - Anirudh Mittal:
  
 Right. Okay. And what about the the second part is text processing, which is there you


21:13:51 - Neilabh Banzal:
  
 Yeah.


21:13:52 - Anirudh Mittal:
  
 have the transcription you want to


21:13:53 - Neilabh Banzal:
  
 Yes.


21:13:53 - Anirudh Mittal:
  
 convert it into meeting minutes format.


21:13:56 - Neilabh Banzal:
  
 Yes.


21:13:56 - Anirudh Mittal:
  
 So how you're doing that?


21:13:59 - Neilabh Banzal:
  
 We are using our Transformers cup pipeline function.


21:14:04 - Anirudh Mittal:
  
 Hmm, can you be more physic?


21:14:04 - Neilabh Banzal:
  
Good. No. Yeah, the library is called Transformers and the function inside that library is called pipeline.


21:14:13 - Siddhesh Pawar:
  
 Hey, is it working like can you show?


21:14:15 - Neilabh Banzal:
  
 Yeah, that I showed that is exactly what I was doing, right? No.


21:14:19 - Siddhesh Pawar:
  
 no, like


21:14:22 - Anirudh Mittal:
  
 And you put output.


21:14:22 - Neilabh Banzal:
  
 Yeah, that is exactly what I will show. You know. This this takes this thing.


21:14:26 - Siddhesh Pawar:
  
 no input in the sense, input is given in form of speech.


21:14:33 - Neilabh Banzal:
  
Ah, so last time if you remember, I said keep we have broken the entire task into two problems. One is as you


21:14:38 - Siddhesh Pawar:
  
 No. But I did now like


21:14:39 - Neilabh Banzal:
  
Huh, are they the at the end? The input is going to be an MP3 file and the output is going to be this summary.


21:14:47 - Anirudh Mittal:
  
 Yeah, let's discuss the second part for now the show was the input in the transcription form and meeting minutes form.


21:14:51 - Neilabh Banzal:
  
 Um, yeah. So


21:14:52 - Anirudh Mittal:
  
meeting minutes


21:14:53 - Neilabh Banzal:
  
Yeah. So this is the input in the transcript file, a format. And on the summary output is is this thing like up? They will need to It travels. And


21:15:05 - Anirudh Mittal:
  
 Is it working right now? Can I give you some transcript? Can you see how that works?


21:15:09 - Neilabh Banzal:
  
 Yeah, sure.


21:15:11 - Anirudh Mittal:
  
 Let's, I'll give you a transcript for the media. Yesterday, we had a meeting yesterday, we transform documented this thing, and I'll show you that


21:15:19 - Neilabh Banzal:
  
 Okay. Um,


21:15:34 - Neilabh Banzal:
  
 let's just run the initialization.


21:15:37 - Anirudh Mittal:
  
 I've shared the file on an email ID, can you access that?


21:15:40 - Neilabh Banzal:
  
 Give me one second. Let me just run over. Okay, my email ID, right? Um


21:15:47 - Anirudh Mittal:
  
 Yeah.


21:15:48 - Neilabh Banzal:
  
 Give me one second. I might stop sharing for a second, my love my screen might go blank for a second.


21:15:58 - Anirudh Mittal:
  
 Yeah.


21:16:02 - Neilabh Banzal:
  
 Okay.


21:16:20 - Neilabh Banzal:
  
Yeah, I'm running obvious to record this and it is slightly slow. Which email ID, Have you shared this one? Is it?


21:16:28 - Anirudh Mittal:
  
Neil you need


21:16:31 - Neilabh Banzal:
  
 There is no email ID, like neela Panzer at iitp.ac.in.


21:16:36 - Anirudh Mittal:
  
 on neelab at the rate, there must be


21:16:38 - Neilabh Banzal:
  
 Okay.


21:16:38 - Anirudh Mittal:
  
 some other


21:16:39 - Neilabh Banzal:
  
 Yeah, neela about the red Gmail iot.


21:16:43 - Anirudh Mittal:
  
 Yeah.


21:16:44 - Neilabh Banzal:
  
 Okay, give me a second.


21:16:46 - Anirudh Mittal:
  
I've shared a document and not the Content. Because this extension that you had said, it saves my image. Also the person who was speaking into saving that. So I'm not why you will use that.


21:16:55 - Neilabh Banzal:
  
 Yeah. No real converted to txt, anyways.


21:17:00 - Anirudh Mittal:
  
 Okay.


21:17:03 - Neilabh Banzal:
  
so maybe we'll have something like which will convert the the document to txt something like that right now I'll just take copy paste it and


21:17:12 - Anirudh Mittal:
  
 What is not being able to use the extension in the real pipeline also.


21:17:16 - Neilabh Banzal:
  
Like we can have two modes of operations. One is using that because what happens is when you have speaker frames, then the abstract summarization process becomes a bit more streamlined, is what I've observed. So if you use the audio directly, then the problem becomes that you don't know who is speaking. What and you say current there is a bit of a mess that it is slightly less love slightly bit. What do you say?


21:17:47 - Anirudh Mittal:
  
Yeah, I understood. But my question then, in that case is, why are you focusing on speech to text? You were saying that you were focusing on me to underscore recognition library, right?


21:17:54 - Neilabh Banzal:
  
 Huh.


21:17:55 - Anirudh Mittal:
  
 You need that in the, in this case,


21:17:56 - Neilabh Banzal:
  
So see suppose someone is not using Google mail, and they don't have this Nam and transcription available.


21:18:04 - Anirudh Mittal:
  
 hmm.


21:18:04 - Neilabh Banzal:
  
In that case, what are they going to do? So suppose someone is using say Zoom or someone is say having an offline meeting in which case they are just turned on their MP3 recorder on on their mobile then still they can use this tool right?


21:18:18 - Anirudh Mittal:
  
Can they because with the if you don't know who is speaking, what? For example, if there's a maid going on and ask who is going to take up this objectives, I say okay, I will


21:18:25 - Neilabh Banzal:
  
 Haha.


21:18:27 - Anirudh Mittal:
  
 take this if you are transcription and understand who spoke. What then when you put that in the


21:18:34 - Neilabh Banzal:
  
 Huh.


21:18:35 - Anirudh Mittal:
  
 meeting,


21:18:35 - Neilabh Banzal:
  
So, that is information that is not available to the summarizer, because you don't know who, who is speaking,


21:18:38 - Anirudh Mittal:
  
 Yeah.


21:18:39 - Neilabh Banzal:
  
Who is what you don't have the names available. So, there is nothing you can do about it actually.


21:18:44 - Anirudh Mittal:
  
 Not really, right? Because this extension is this extension exist? So could you


21:18:49 - Neilabh Banzal:
  
I'll never that is exactly what I said, suppose the meeting is on Google meet, I have extensions suppose. The Google is a meat is on


21:18:55 - Anirudh Mittal:
  
Yes, Michael Yes, Michael Finance but if the code for this extension is available, could video is but try to find similar codes that can help you. Found always cooking what and then Implement that instead of using like a just


21:19:07 - Neilabh Banzal:
  
Oh no no. These extensions actually use Google Calendar. Because well let me come undercut season so that is not something that you can simply put to zoom or anything else. So Google.


21:19:19 - Anirudh Mittal:
  
Okay, answer this example. Let's say we are not focusing on everything. First of all things, no sense of focusing on everything. Unless, of course, the product is excellent. Let me works on everything then only you should focus on a Target group of users that you can use zoom and everything.


21:19:33 - Neilabh Banzal:
  
 Huh.


21:19:33 - Anirudh Mittal:
  
That's That's assume we will only making stuff for people who very big


21:19:36 - Neilabh Banzal:
  
 Yeah.


21:19:37 - Anirudh Mittal:
  
 username anyways. So for those people finally, if you


21:19:40 - Neilabh Banzal:
  
 Huh.


21:19:43 - Anirudh Mittal:
  
extension, I mean, the end of the project is we're supposed to make like a product, right? So can you, let's say, if you have to


21:19:49 - Neilabh Banzal:
  
 Today.


21:19:51 - Anirudh Mittal:
  
make their own extension for them, maybe extension but you won't be able to do. But we have other people from the in the other group who know how to make an extension and they will do it in a couple of days.


21:20:01 - Neilabh Banzal:
  
 Okay.


21:20:02 - Anirudh Mittal:
  
If you take their health, can we make an on our own that can post? Take this input from Google need just transcription including most of what and then using Or summarize or to make Google meet the minutes of the mood.


21:20:15 - Neilabh Banzal:
  
 I can't comment just now, sorry because I'm not seeing, what kind of implementation of the extension is there in here? I'll have to take that before I can make any comments. Yeah.


21:20:30 - Anirudh Mittal:
  
 think I find more let's just


21:20:41 - Neilabh Banzal:
  
Yeah, my laptop is going extremely slow, because I have to run all of these. And next, it will. It's downloaded. Let's see. Yeah, this is, this is the kind of thing. You will have read


21:21:12 - Anirudh Mittal:
  
 Oh yes.


21:21:12 - Neilabh Banzal:
  
 So there are no images here, we can convert that to take place. I should not. Right. Okay. This is done on. Enter. Let's go down.


21:21:43 - Neilabh Banzal:
  
Right. Right thing on and then somebody text. Everything, is this? Hmm. Okay. That's what that was about. I have to break this into Parts, this too long. so, Let's do it under here.


21:22:22 - Anirudh Mittal:
  
 He could take and dig the first half movie.


21:22:24 - Neilabh Banzal:
  
Yeah, I don't identify Smith. Thanks. For. Let's see. Um, so, Up, I'll automate this according to maximum number of word, limits obiers, who circulation like about. Basically, if you exceed that and then throws this error,


21:22:58 - Anirudh Mittal:
  
 Okay.


21:23:00 - Neilabh Banzal:
  
 Of the students are doing that. Make it even shorter. Give me a minute. So, the way we are planning to handle, this is keep we simply split it into parts. According to the world limits. I think that. Oh okay, let's put it here.


21:23:54 - Neilabh Banzal:
  
You have a look, oh. I'll have to see what is happening and figure out camera. Maybe there is some other issue.


21:24:09 - Anirudh Mittal:
  
 TK cooler, but just let us know what the output is on.


21:24:13 - Neilabh Banzal:
  
Yeah, I'll post the output on on Google group. I'll have to see. Maybe it's, it's like taking all of these digits separately and the word word is becoming too much, I'll just have to pass through and like remove. I'll have to see what is happening here.


21:24:32 - Anirudh Mittal:
  
Okay cool. So I think on to you know your objectives which is one day we are going to meet and we will be expecting all the three teams to give a demo and based on the output is


21:24:40 - Neilabh Banzal:
  
 Okay.


21:24:43 - Anirudh Mittal:
  
shared. We just share. You can just share what the output is. We can maybe give some comments on, what, what all you can plan to do in the next one week, other than mostly documentation, you have to update


21:24:51 - Neilabh Banzal:
  
 Okay.


21:24:53 - Anirudh Mittal:
  
documentation, documentation, you have to update. Yeah, I think that, I think that's the top you have, if possible trying


21:24:58 - Neilabh Banzal:
  
 so,


21:24:58 - Anirudh Mittal:
  
You have if to go to, what would create the proper pipeline of code which is you send the audio and directly you get


21:25:03 - Neilabh Banzal:
  
 Okay.


21:25:05 - Anirudh Mittal:
  
 something instead of two separate


21:25:05 - Neilabh Banzal:
  
 Okay.


21:25:07 - Anirudh Mittal:
  
 things, try to merge, both of them so that you can just keep and you


21:25:11 - Neilabh Banzal:
  
Right. I think that was our plan for this week, anyway, to immerse the pipeline, but if you are finally using this extension, then Let me see like what we can figure out. How we can have the time left a


21:25:31 - Anirudh Mittal:
  
 Okay.


21:25:33 - Neilabh Banzal:
  
pipeline. You can also have a pipeline, they keep you. You just share the document and then we download that document in in a dock exodert txt or not. And then on WE directly like use that.


21:25:48 - Anirudh Mittal:
  
See they finally use the use case that we can see is we can actually, you know, make an extension that can by people if we make the into anything. For example, let's use here. Okay, fine, we don't have the extension yet, but everything else. So everybody which is if you get the audio because we have you can make the extensions on the other team. They have been focusing on an extension or so that's completed by


21:26:09 - Neilabh Banzal:
  
 Okay.


21:26:12 - Anirudh Mittal:
  
the fluency. We can continue before one, two weeks more and the model and everything to take the audio. And with the minute means, this is


21:26:21 - Neilabh Banzal:
  
 Okay.


21:26:21 - Anirudh Mittal:
  
definitely, I don't know. A lot of meetings. For example, our Resort Europe meeting, right? It goes on for years and one takes many many because it's like very difficult. I mean, who will spend so much thing, you will definitely useful. So just try to make the end to end timeline, it's okay. If you don't make the extension with it right now that we can do after soccer, but the pipelines will be convincing enough for us to know me. Put some more efforts to this at the end of the
