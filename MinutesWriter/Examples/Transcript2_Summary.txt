Summary: Currently wnc has given as sort of Hard stuff on 24 like it may get extended, but we need to complete better 24 . The plan is going to create a common repo for either. The next Sunday, we'll have some kind of demo by three teams, seeing whatever they have built . If you have any code that you have used for learning in searching, you can. If you use the audio directly, then the problem becomes that you don't know who is speaking . So, there is nothing you can do about it actually. Not really, right?. One day we are going to meet and we will be expecting all the three teams to give a demo and based on the output is shared . We can maybe give some comments on, what. Google Chrome Store on product and things like that. That sounds like a good idea. Cooled and so I think cooled . Any anything else from your side? Otherwise we'll move
